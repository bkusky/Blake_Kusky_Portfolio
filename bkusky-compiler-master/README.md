Code for BMinor Project
-------------------------------

This directory contains the code for the BMinor compiler.

The module 'library.c' contains the "standard library" for bminor,
which is needed to implement the print statement and the exponentiation
operator.  You are welcome to add items to the library if you find
it helpful.  Set up your Makefile carefully: library.c should be
linked against a compiled bminor program, not against the compiler itself.
